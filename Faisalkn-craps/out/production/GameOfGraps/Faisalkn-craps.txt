Assignment Overview:
(Describe your understanding of the purpose and scope of the assignment in 250 words or less.
The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over. Do not just copy
text from the assignment description.)

The assignment requires creating a Java application for a Craps game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The primary goal is to implement a functional
and visually appealing representation of the Craps game, allowing users to play and interact with the game elements. The Craps game involves rolling two dice,
and the application should handle various outcomes based on the rules of the game.
The scope encompasses designing and coding multiple components, including a main game window, panels for displaying scores and the game state,
buttons for actions like rolling the dice, and integration with a bank system to manage the player's bets. Additionally, the assignment involves incorporating
sound effects for a more engaging user experience. The GUI elements should be intuitive, providing clear feedback on the game's progress,
displaying relevant information such as scores and dice outcomes. The application should allow users to reset the game, place bets, and handle different game scenarios,
such as winning or losing rounds


Technical Impression:
(Describe what you have done to complete the assignment in 200-500 words.
The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over; however,
summaries that do not meet the minimum length requirement or are trivial in nature
(representing little thought or effort) will not get full credit. You can share your
personal experiences, things that particularly frustrated you about the assignment,
things that particularly interested you about the assignment, etc. It is especially
important that you document any difficulties you had with tools, Java libraries, etc.)


Completing this assignment was quite challenging, especially because it involved creating a Java-based Craps game using Swing for the graphical interface.
I have never created a game before but it's very hard connecting and having the complete game. Adding to the difficulty,
I had final exams in other classes during the same week, making it a tough period for me. The complexity of designing various panels,
managing game states, and implementing the bank system required a careful approach.
Dealing with the randomness in dice outcomes was particularly tricky, and I had to write the Junit test first for it. A major obstacle was connecting panels across different classes smoothly.
I was getting object is null, I had to think of a different approach because the classes don't have any idea of the other classes except if you pass it by the constructor parameter.
Ensuring a seamless transition of states and maintaining a clear separation of concerns required focused effort and effective event handling. Despite the difficulties,
this assignment significantly improved my understanding of GUI development, object-oriented principles, and practical application of Java Swing.
It also highlighted the importance of adaptability and time management during challenging weeks with concurrent final exams.


Unresolved problems in my submission:

(Use this space to list problems which you know exist in your submission. This could
include program features which you did not have time to implement, bugs in your code,
warnings generated by the tools which you did not understand or did not have time to correct,
or other issues. I give a reduced grade penalty for problems which I find in your submission
that are listed here and a larger penalty for those which are not. Just say 'none' if
there are no issues that you are aware of.)

I did my best to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure as instructed. However, there's a chance that the arrangement of classes in
the MVC package may not be perfect.

I watched bro code youtube channel and learned how to use layout manager instead of the setbound methods.
This made my game responsive to size.

Extra credit:
List any extra credit items completed. Be as specific as possible.
I have added images for dices and I also added images on some Joptionpane. I also added sound on roll dice, win game and lose game sound.
(Sounds and Images) extra credits completed.
